Comments to the author
======================

Paper provides a macro-placement methodology for faster
manual physical design for designs with a large number of
macros. Author has provided a description of the steps
taken for the physical design of an AI processor and the
corresponding area and power improvements. 

To make the paper more useful for the readers, it would be
beneficial for the author to first clearly state the
generalized algorithm (generalized steps proposed for
improving the manual physical design), and then describe
how the algorithm/steps were applied to physical design of
the specific AI processor. At the moment it's relatively
difficult for a reader to clearly extract the steps that
he/she should infer and apply to his/her own physical
design.
